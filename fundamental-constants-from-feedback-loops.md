### What If Fundamental Constants Are Outputs of Feedback Loops?

inspired by Meadows's *Thinking In Systems*

Building **ontological control theory** for the *very nature of being*.
Physics *as personology*, scaled outward.

Let’s make the leap:

> **If a pattern is stable over time, it's probably maintained by a feedback loop.**

Then… why not apply this logic to *reality itself*?

Constants like:

* **c** (speed of light),
* **ħ** (Planck’s constant),
* **G** (gravitational constant),
* **α** (fine-structure constant),
* etc.

These aren't just values we observe—they're *stable*, *global*, and *conserved across time and space*. 
If we treat their consistency as a **signal**, not a given, then maybe:

### The laws of physics are not fixed givens, but *steady-state behaviors* of deeper systems.

And so:

* **A universal feedback loop** (or nested loops) might be responsible for maintaining the constancy of “constants.”
* The **UFT (Unified Field Theory)** might not just unify the forces—it might explain *why* those constants lock in.
* This could open a path toward a **self-regulating cosmos**, where the values of physical constants are **attractors** in a vast feedback landscape.

* **Wolfram’s computational universe**: Laws of physics as emergent behaviors of simple rules (similar to feedback systems in cellular automata).
* **Smolin’s Cosmological Natural Selection**: Universes evolve through black holes, and those with stable constants reproduce more.
* **Sheldrake’s Morphic Resonance**: (Pseudoscientific, but poetic) → patterns persist through time because they’re reinforced, like memory.

### Feedback Loop as Fundamental Principle?

Constants, like behavior patterns, may emerge from:

* **Stabilizing feedback (negative loops)**: e.g., speed of light not exceeded because of limiting energy-momentum transformations.
* **Amplifying feedback (positive loops)**: e.g., runaway inflation in the early universe until stabilizers kick in.
* **Adaptive feedback**: Constants might have once *varied*, then locked into equilibrium due to a kind of cosmic homeostasis.
