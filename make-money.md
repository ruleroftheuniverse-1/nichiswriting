You cannot _make_ money, strictly speaking. You can only trade for it. 
Likewise, money is not truly _spent_, simply traded away.
That is, our usual uses of the phrases "making money" and "spending money" in fact refer to increasing and decreasing amounts of money within a given system, be it personal, familial, national, etc. finances.

This is of major ethical importance because it means that one's involvement with money can only have an indirect relationship with production and consumption. Someone can have a high income or net worth and yet consume less than most do. Someone can also have no income and a negative net worth and yet consume more actual resources than most do. 
The former can happen via high levels of saving or investment, spending on low-consumption goods/services, or a lot of giving.
The latter can happen via access to credit, bartering, having one's consumption needs provided for by someone else, or simply taking things without asking.

Who we trade with and the kinds of deals we make do matter, tho. 
Since only the things money is traded for are actually produced or consumed, any money spent by one system is made by another, and vice-versa. So, making is always taking from someone, and spending is always giving to someone. Our choices of how to make and spend money thus directly influence the economic power of others. 

This means, for instance, that a scam is generally neither productive nor consumptive, merely a transfer. A trade of money for illusory value. What determines the ethical status of the scam is the intended uses of either party. 

Trades can be mutually beneficial or predatory. The former is very often a source of much of the world's problems. 
The overall ethical value of a trade is based on the effects on each party and the uses of each party.
Let's assume for the sake of argument that you'll use your powers in good ways.
If a trade is mutually beneficial, then it's good _unless_ the other party will do more harm with their benefit that you can do good with yours. 
If a trade is predatory, i.e. unbalanced, in your favor, then it's good if you're extracting from someone worse, and bad otherwise. And if it's unbalanced against you, then it can be good nonetheless to be prey for someone better.
The remaining possibility--a trade that is bad for both parties--can actually still be worthwhile. This is very common in military logic--war is a lose-lose situation, but disempowering someone doing bad can be worth the expenditure of power.
In a sense, all of these are modes of ascending to a meta-trade to gain an advantage at a higher level within the shared environment system.
