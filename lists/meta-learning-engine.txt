Meta–Learning Engine

Here's a potential map for organizing the things I want to learn:
	Core – Skills that accelerate all others
		Math (linear algebra, PDEs)
		Programming (Python, C)
		Formal logic + set theory
	Field Nodes – Subjects with high interdisciplinary utility
		Thermodynamics
		Systems theory
		Information theory
		Signal processing / Fourier analysis
		Quantum mechanics / standard model
	Applied Nodes – Stuff you love for its own sake
		Biochem 
		Political theory (for praxis)
		Fanonian psychoanalysis (for self + others)
		Rural survival / infrastructure engineering
	Recursive tools – Tools that teach you how to learn
		Spaced repetition
		Writing / summarizing / teaching
		Modeling cognition as an algorithm
	Joy Nodes
		Birdsong
		Soundwave pattern recognition
		Fire metaphors
		Human weirdness
