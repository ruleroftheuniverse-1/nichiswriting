## motivation of essay 

Power is a central concept in many fields of study, and a central desiderata of many people in many areas of their lives. Some fields, like physics, tend to place it a bit away from the center. 

In the language of systems, power is one system's ability to control the behavior of another. Its many forms are an inescapable part of life, and understanding what it is and how it works is thus worthwhile.
