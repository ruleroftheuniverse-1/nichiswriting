To play Nintendo DS games on iOS devices:

1. Download the game you want from 
https://myrient.erista.me/files/No-Intro/Nintendo%20-%20Nintendo%20DS%20%28Decrypted%29/

2. Either use the DeSmuME web emulator or else download and run the Delta app.

Web emulator is quicker and easier to get setup for a single session. Delta is more efficient for longer term, repeated use.

To use the web emulator, go to:
https://www.desmume.com/online/
Then upload the game you downloaded in step 1.

To use Delta, download the app from: 
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/delta-game-emulator/id1048524688
Then start the app and open the game from step 1.
