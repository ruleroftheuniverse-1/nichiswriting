Since some friends are protesting a Confederate statue on their campus, such statues are on my mind again. I think the difference between remembering history and honoring people has been gone over thoroughly enough I won't say any more about it. But there's a few more oddities I'd like to note:
* The people who say they want to remember history (as a defense of the statues) seem to, generally, be quite in favor of "moving on" from slavery and other historical travesties. If you're serious about remembering or preserving history, you can't erase monstrosities. 
* In line with remembering history, if we're to remember the history of the US via statues, we should probably recognize the people who built this country: Largely slaves, and the most of the rest the rest of the poor. If anyone should be getting statues for making this country, it should be them. (And if we want memorable individuals, the Oliver video linked below ends with a few good options.)
* States' rights remains a mystery to me, if taken seriously. Wanting a powerful federal government makes sense (though I disagree), and wanting strong individual freedoms also makes sense. Wanting strong governments over smaller areas makes a bit less sense to me. Especially when those smaller areas aren't even politically coherent. I can think of some things that would be good US-wide or world-wide (e.g. basic freedoms for all people) and some stuff the government shouldn't touch (how much carbonated sugar water I drink), but I can't think of anything that makes sense at some very intermediate level. A very local level might work, as then you have communities deciding, but none of the 50 US states are communities. 
Instead usually "states' rights" appears to be a codeword for "I know my position is not popular nationally, but it is popular in the US state I live in, and I want my position to dominate regardless of any underlying values." You can usually tell by the positions losing popularity turning into "states' rights" issues. People who were very happy with DOMA in 1996 suddenly became very concerned with states' rights 10-20 years later. 
* I don't understand the protests against statues. Get a rope. Tie one end to the statue and the other to the back of a truck. Hit the gas on the truck. If the statue isn't broken, use some sledgehammers to obliterate it. Now there's no statue. And the question moves from "Should we take down the statue?" to "Should we build a new statue?" Bureaucracy leaves many ways to stall the status quo indefinitely. Want to make sure something never happens? Never let it get to a vote. Push it off until the next meeting every meeting. The status quo is, for some people, comfy. If someone has bureaucratic power, odds are the status quo is comfy for them. Destroy the statues and now the status quo is no statues. (And if building replacements is the option chosen, a new question of what to replace them with becomes a further question.)
