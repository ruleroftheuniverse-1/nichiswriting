i dislike how the "-ology" words became synonymous with their objects of study.
like, in common language, whatever, people use what they use, but in technical contexts, we can have prescribed definitions.
psychology is the study (or science) of the psychic (mental)
biology the study of the biotic (living)
sociology the study of the social (societal)
etc...
so e.g. to say someone has a "psychological disorder" is to say they have a condition impairing the functioning of their study of mind. That's...not how it's used tho. 
a "biological woman" is a woman relating to the science of biotia, which is to say a female biologist. (hi! ☺)
"sociological problems" are problems in the study of society, which at least often enough are directly based on the societal problems people use the term to refer to.
