Awesome that neuroscientists have designed a game to help rather than just exploit people with ADHD.

Absolutely disgusting that doctors are withholding access to a *video game* unless one pays them for a prescription.

Looking further into it, I'm seeing it's $99 for a 30-day prescription, in addition to whatever fees the doctor charges for the diagnosis, appointment, etc.

And ofc, if anyone tries to make copies for poor kids with ADHD to access? They'll call for the state to use force to try to stop us.
Because doctors are classists who care more about their licenses, extreme incomes, and membership in their elitist social and professional groups than others' lives or well-being.
Much of the job is just leveraging an education disparity to extract wealth from people. But they hide it by acting like receiving a medical education is some major sacrifice on their part, rather than the massive privilege it truly is. 

While you can't directly fix their behavior, you can stop believing their narratives. You don't have to pretend their consumption addictions aren't deadly to others. And you can look outside of abusive systems
