Brangulis et al 2024

structural biology study that uses X-ray crystallography to map a key enzyme in _Borrelia burgdorferi_ (the Lyme disease bacterium)

study examines FtsH 
	a conserved ATP-dependent metalloprotease 
		like a molecular shredder that: 
			recognizes damaged or unnecessary proteins, 
			unfolds them using energy from ATP, 
			degrades them with a zinc-based protease site 
		Without it, the bacterium dies.

Bb version of FtsH called BB0789
	hadn’t been structurally solved before this study
	known to be essential for infectivity in both ticks and mammals 
	researchers set out to map its structure and confirm whether it still behaves like a true FtsH enzyme
	
Bb is metabolically lazy 
	scavenges lipids, amino acids, and nucleotides from its hosts (instead of making them) 
		dependency means it needs an agile membrane protein system for transport and secretion
			but misfolded or unneeded proteins can clog the system. 
			FtsH is the cleanup crew.

Like other bacterial FtsH proteins, BB0789 has:
	- Two transmembrane α-helices that anchor it to the inner membrane.
	- A small periplasmic domain that helps it assemble and function.
	- A cytosolic AAA+ ATPase domain for unfolding substrates.
	- A zinc-dependent M41 peptidase domain that cuts them up.

The authors focus on the soluble cytosolic portion (residues 146–639), because membrane regions are notoriously hard to crystallize.
