Summary of Highlights Through Section 2.7
Chapters 1–2.7: Ontological Foundations Through Enumeration

1. Enumeration and Identity

The book establishes enumeration as the foundation of physical theory. To describe a system, one must count distinguishable alternatives.

This counting leads naturally into Hilbert spaces and basis vectors in quantum theory.

The notion of “what can be distinguished” is treated as fundamental, not derived—a move that quietly shifts ontology toward epistemic minimalism.

2. Sets, Properties, and Perspective

Properties only exist in relation to observers—or more precisely, to partitions of possibility space.

There’s an emphasis on relational structure: not just “what is,” but “what is distinguishably different.”

3. Measurement and Probability

The text does a slow build toward the Born rule, developing probability from distinguishability, not as an axiom.

Measurement is framed not just as discovery but reduction of a possibility space through enumeration.

4. Quantum Weirdness via Counting

Superposition and entanglement are not “weird” when viewed as structure in possibility space defined by countable bases.

The language of counting flips the ontology: instead of particles or waves, the fundamental entity is the space of alternatives.
