Reading McManus's _The Political Right and Equality_. 
It's not the collection I was anticipating, but rather an extended analysis of and attack on the political right.

There's a degree of truth to finding the critics responsible for dissatisfaction. E.g. my emotions are caused by activity in my head, that is, me. If critics were to be satisfied instead of dissatisfied, that would indeed reduce the dissatisfaction. Moreover, wrecking the worldviews of satisfied people does contribute to dissatisfaction.

The problem is that satisfaction isn't all that good in itself. After all, the people with the means to spend all their time on drugs that induce euphoria do not do so. 
Never hunger, never prosper.
