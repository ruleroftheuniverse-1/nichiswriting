I selected the image with three people and two arrows going in opposite directions.
There’s also a square grid in the background filled with many colors.

The top arrow points upward and carries one person, who’s holding what seem to be important documents, like one or two papers in hand with a third sheet floating just behind.
The bottom arrow points downward and has two people beneath it. Unlike the person above, they have no papers, and both have their hands raised high.

My interpretation is that the two people on the bottom are trying to get the arrow’s attention, maybe because they fell off, dropped their papers, and are scrambling to get back on before it’s too late.
It appears they’re flagging it down like a subway or a taxi they’re about to miss.

But then the person at the top looks much more in control, almost as if they’re navigating the arrow themselves and telling it where to go.
They were probably once like the two below, but instead of getting upset that the arrow was about to pass, they threw a lasso around it and climbed on so they wouldn’t miss it or let it pass them by anymore.
