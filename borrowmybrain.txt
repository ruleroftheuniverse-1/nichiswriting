Borrow My Brain — 1-pager (drop anywhere):
Title: Borrow My Brain — Sprints / Systems / Strategy
I do: I turn ambiguous problems into small working things—fast.
Great for: scrappy researchers, educators, v1 product & infra.
Receipts:
• Cut a 3-week research task to 3 hours with a constraints-first pass.
• Stood up a demo over a weekend; shipped a readable README.
• Taught non-experts a complex topic in 90 minutes with custom scaffolds.
How it works:

30-min live attack (we work your mess in real time)

48-hour artifact (doc, prototype, or plan)

7 days of async check-ins (keeps momentum)
Pilot pricing: Pay-what-proves-value for my first 3 fall slots.
